                            begins utilizing ISO 9001 quality standards. We provide your company with a job reference
                            number that allows you easily and securely track the progress of your tool on-line – 24 hrs
                            a day, 7 days a week through our website portal. This will include access to all relevant
                            data, timelines and recent images related to your tooling project.</p>

                        <p>Once we have collected all of the data for your job, including your company’s specific
                            technical standards, we proceed to the design phase of your project. At Duradie, we work
                            with state-of-the-art technology to produce completely integrated and parametric CAD designs
                            that will meet and exceed your products specifications and quality standards. Complete
                            in-house design assures customers that all projects including design specifications and
                            technical criteria are accurately incorporated. Our vaulted file management system
                            guarantees all designs are current and real time. Duradie’s finished products match the
                            designs – guaranteed.<br /><br />

                            Duradie proves all design process integrity through the use of Metal Forming Simulation
                            software to identify and eliminate potential areas of concern prior to tool build.</p>

                            Machining and Wire EDM technology along with up to 110 tons of overhead lifting capacity to
                            enable us to complete the manufacturing of the entire job in-house. Our team performs all
                            CNC programming and machining to ensure optimal control over lead times and quality of work.

                        <p>In recognizing the distinct value of receiving high quality initial samples off “soft”
                            tooling, Duradie has brought this service in-house through the introduction of our NTC
                            TLM610 (5 Axis) Laser System and a Flow Dynamic WaterJet system.<br /><br />

                            To accelerate the tooling process and ensure the precision of production tools, we can
                            produce laser cut samples off “soft” production tooling for pre-production purposes. Our
                            fully trained craftsmen along with integrated CAD software are at your service to provide
                            the finest quality laser cutting that will exceed your expectations.<br /><br />

                            We have also developed a quick change part holding laser fixturing system to complete the
                            sample manufacturing process.<br /><br />

                            Our range of tryout presses, up to 1250 tons, allows us to best approximate your production
                            environment, identifying and eliminating problems before they happen.</p>

                        <p>Part verification is an essential element of the Duradie process. Once the tooling is
                            completed, we run samples at our in-house tryout facilities and complete Initial Sample
                            Reports (ISR). Through our fully computerized CMM machine we can complete GR&R studies, full
                            part layouts and capability (CPK) studies that will assure the accuracy and quality of both
                            the tooling and the produced components.<br /><br />

                            Our Duradie Onsite Support team also accompany your tooling to your facility to provide
                            setup support and expedite your part approval process.<br /><br />

                            It is our goal to ensure that all projects exceed your standards and expectations, and
                            arrive on time, every time.<br /><br />
